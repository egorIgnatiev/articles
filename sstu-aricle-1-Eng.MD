Introduction
Terminologically digitalization means transformation of third technological paradigm to fourth and fifth, though large-scale digital technologies implementation into economics and others fields of society activity [1]. 
  Digitalization is using digital ways of information handling, and creating, based on that, new tools its transmission and spreading. Herewith digital transformation affects all types of entrepreneur activity, economic sectors, including educational field [4].
Digital systems represent extremely high efficiency of using information, let to handle big volumes of data, have high speed of information transfer, and also allow to optimize technological process management [5,6].
Issues of increasing educational processes digitalization level in high education institutes directly linked with increasing of completeness of national economic systems, as a chronic lag of applying of actual information, incomplete, timeless, and not enough usage of digital resources by universities leads to loss of market positions, and the attractiveness of the domestic educational system [7].
Therefore, it is universities in current globalization reality and informational technologies progression are placed at the center of creating new development conceptions based on human activity transformation process which handle with modern information technologies. Due to such privileges as ease of use, high data transfer rate, fast reaction on changes in environment, new managing goals and significant competitive advantages of educational services are achieved. With this approach it becomes possible to design new processes in university, particularly, online-learning what leads to reducing costs, optimizing time of learning and enhancing its availability, flexible opportunities of student-oriented education and academic collaboration [2, 3].
Changes in educational process caused by introduction of digital and remote learning technology, require flexible change management: getting more objective feedback for educational process management and effective organization of structure and contents of learning resources for each student, respect diversity, preferences, needs, and aims, knowledge level ‘growth’ dynamics, development of personal educational plan [8]. No need to lie, in modern university academic platforms is becoming more important, aimed on scientific discoveries and knowledge production, connecting education with researching, and also providing broad access to students from different demographic and socio-economic groups [9].
By this way, digital university transformation should be treated as a critical area of activity both worldwide and for our country in particular, which can be proved by governmental support of digitalization in Russia [10].
 
Current university digitalization level
Digital transformation of a such enormous organization like Samara State Technical University can’t happen in the blink of an eye, although the first steps were taken in 2003 development of website hasn’t completely finished yet, while new modules are added or refactored. At the moment more than five tens modules are developed, responsible for different university functioning areas and lead to relieving students’ and employees’ activities. One of the most noticeable examples is a students’ rating system, automatically calculating indicators based on students’ achievements in scientific and learning area, and distinguishing the most talented students to attract them to further scientific activities, relying on these calculated indicators.
Another major module used quite often is an enrollee module, providing real-time monitoring the number of applications submitted on chosen specialty, thanks to that the load on admission committee employees is reduced and the work efficacy is enhanced what means – the more people can make their application.
Telling about advantages of digital structure needs to mention how it works inside, by example of the module for generating reports. The algorithm presented on the figure below.

As can be seen, the user needs to select the needed data, for instance, the interested department, publication year or check state, and get this information in few seconds whilst without such an instrument, it could be take multiple days. 
Another important aspect is enhancement university access system. In 2008 year was launched system of digital ID access cards. These cards were issued individually for every student or employee. An access card must be applied to turnstile for university entrancement, then occurs reading its digital ID, checking a presence this ID in database, what lets to allow or deny come in. This helps significantly reduce the risk of unauthored entrance of strangers on the campus territory, what improves protection against terrorist threats and extremism.
Not a less useful and handy a different display of university digitalization – the informational stand located on the main campus, (photographed on Fig.3), which lets guests, students and employees to instantly get information about location different departments, details about the university and a lot of another kinds of information.

In addition to everything said above, university digitalization helps to advantage new opportunities for educational process, particularly, remote learning form. It became highly demanded due to COVID-2019. This activity was implemented within automated informational system (AIS). The students had lectures though remote conferences, attendance in which was registered automatically in their AIS profile, and here are provided tasks for practice what let to ensure in uninterrupted operation of the university with an appropriate medical safety level. Besides that, due to especially developed module, were implemented remote exams enrollment, for what on the website automatically generates time of exams, examinator selection, and questions for each student, what lets to reach more thorough knowledge attestation and reduce impact of interpersonal relationships on impartiality of assessment.
Simplified the process of hosting various events such as invited specialist lectures, conferences, refresher courses, accelerators, intra-university competitions and olympiads. To organize a new event, it’s enough to publish informational announcement about participation on the university website, and turn on automatic newsletter for all interested people and organizations. After that, all interested people sign up to attend in corresponding event, get special QR code, which’s treated as a special ID access card.  Responsible representative for the event, scanning this code, automatically adds this ID into the database, related to the current event, providing this owner details. Such a type of automatization is raising awareness level what lets to growth the number of hosted events.
A different possibility became available under campus digitalization project is an opportunity for university graduates and potential employers to connect with each other for further mutually beneficial cooperation. This opportunity is provided by two main ways, in first, by organizing job fairs, which were implemented by using available AIS databases, applied for targeted selection of students, who will most probably be interested in proposed possibilities, and notifying about them all interested parties. In second, due to a possibility for companies to publish in corresponding section list of opened vacancies, on which a student can apply for, all information about them will be send to proposed employer automatically.
Among other things, digital system AIS was used to handle such types of events as crossdiscipline projects teams or project intensives. Using of digital factor was a quite significant. In first, exactly there were tested enrollment tests, by using these were selected capable students for attending in such activities. In the next, by running AIS it became possible to build a proper co-working model for every person involved, and also left a personal digital feedback for every event attended in.

Further development university digitalization
Looking at all current achievements, without any doubt, worth appreciating and also prospects of further digital university digitalization.
Using XXI century digital technologies opens an infinite spectrum of further improvement or creating new informational system (IS). It’s impossible not to note an active development of adaption in educational stack promising technologies, creation methodologies and architectural modules in Russia in the last decade.
Currently, exists a huge bunch of technologies can be adopted for enhancement working digital part of university. Common structure is shown on Fig. 4. Here can be seen the common areas of modern technologies, every of which has rather difficult internal stricture.

 
 
Fig. 4 Common structure of modern technologies	

A modern informational system which relies on these technologies, should match certain criteria:
•	reliance and high persistence, provided by usage first-class server hardware, UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply), database replication and clasterization, backups;
•	security and data protection, handled by the last developments with advanced authentication systems (two-factor authentication), modern encryption protocols (TLS 1.3);
•	cross-platformness and usability, lets users to use devices of different vendors and class, designation and size to work with IS, not also desktop PCs, but also smartphones, tables, laptops, or even wearables;
•	 versatility and easy, this is step towards to program code quality, usage of modern libraries, frameworks, what lets to easily add new developers to the current team and lower ‘entry threshold’.
It would be great to emphasize the next perspective set of technologies for now and not too distant future can be applied to AIS ‘University’:
•	PhoneGap – framework, which lets to create cross-platform mobile app with using JavaScript language with a feature of native integration with device OS, unlike usual web-applications [11];
•	Electron – framework, has the same possibility, but in its turn lets to create application not for smartphones, but for computers and laptops based on Windows, Mac, and Lunix on a single codebase [12];
•	Angular/React/Vue/Svelte, frameworks for creating modern SPA, built on MVC model [13-16];
•	TLS 1.3 – the last version of encryption protocol for obtaining secure connection with websites [17].
Let’s consider the concepts can be recommended for usage in AIS ‘University’:
•	Adaptive (responsible) design, lets to create only one application with universal, changing UI for different screen and device sizes, be it desktop PCs, smartphones, tablets, laptops or even wearables [18];
•	SPA («Single Page Application»), a method of creating application when all the code and styles loaded entirely and at once, and further info display occurs without page reloading, and only by loading a needed small set of data;
•	MVC («Model-View-Controller») – a way of separating application code on three important parts, what reduces confusion, and though differentiation, brings convivence in app development; Common MVC structure shown on Fig. 5. [19]
•	Mobile-first – a such type of prototyping UI and programmic code, which targets on creation minimalist interfaces and using a small number of resources (such as using as less as possible CPU time, RAM, bandwidth), and after that, if it needed, integrating additional functional or functions for only desktop PCs.
 
Fig. 5 MVC structure

Also, it’s decided not to limit current scientific work only to AIS portal, and spread digitalization to more areas, using these stages:
•	using special mobile application for smartphones with NFC instead of using ID access cards;
•	stop using access cards at all, due to transition on intellectual pattern recognition system of people coming in the campus;
•	apply developments, aimed to creating self-learning neural networks to solve as scientific (calculations, modeling technological processes), and management task, such as making an educational process more optimized, and creating more optimal students’ and teachers’ schedule [21-22].
It needs to take a close took to using neural network for university digitalization. The main aim — working with big data, based on fuzzy logic algorithms [23]. 
      As an example of using this technology is a module, for automatic timetable generation. This module needs a great amount of input data, a structure of which presented on Fig. 5.

 
Fig. 5 Major data needed for timetable generation


This module development is a technically hard process due to the fact that there’s a lot input data of different kind, as can be seen from Fig. 5. Here you can see what data should be added into neural network to correct schedule generation after it will be learned on the same criterias and timetables of previous years.
 At the moment, students’ and teachers’ timetable creation is handled manually. It requires to perform a high volume of work, taking a long time. This process can be split on multiple parts, with digitalization technique it becomes possible to automate some stages. In first, on timetable generation stage (marked as ‘3’ on Fig. 6) it lets to save up a lot of time due to using of neural network, what lets to reduce schedule creation time from 4 weeks to a few seconds, at the time, stage ‘5’ on Fig. 6 represents sharing information about new timetable, it will be became instant as it will be loaded on AIS portal.
To demonstrate the efficiency of using the algorithm during solving this task, was created a histogram, Fig. 6. In this histogram, the y-axis shows how much time elapsed for the corresponding stage, the x-axis – stage number.

 
Fig. 6 Time elapsed on creating timetable manually and with AI algorithm

As can be noted, using neural networks for generating student’ schedule can save up on the average more than one month.
Another developing module, worthing of talking about, is a monitoring system of students’ presense on face-to-face studies. For this method it needs to use computer vision and pattern recognition technologies.
When working on this module, is is proposed to use the next algorithm.

Conclusion
Digital transformation is inevitable process for any university, according to current trends. It’s not hard to see, in case of Samara State Technical University, at the moment almost all main structures, linked with educational and scientific activity, were undergone digitalization process.
Further development involves for the most part two main targets. In first, it is improving existing modules by applying new technologies instead of deprecated ones, for improvement performance current codebase.
The second direction is development new modules and services based on new technologies, not used so far, based on computer vision, pattern recognition, using of distributed networking and network network models.
